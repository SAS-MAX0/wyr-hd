# Would You Rather Gesture Control

Enter the game of "Would You Rather," the old party game brought into the new days and redesigned by the technological advancing world. It is an interactive web game which can enable you to execute tough decisions with the use of gestures only, and they can be performed by your hand solely because of real-time tracking which is performed within the browser.

## Features

- **Dynamic Choices**: There are numerous categories of rounds such as cars, companies, food, and superheroes with a set of mixed-up questions.

- **Instant Feedback**: Once per decision, you will read the percentage of a player agreement and find out the popularity of your decision.

- **Fluid Animations**: By using fluid animations, you feel more confident about your choices as they seem to be more significant.

- **Fully In-Browser**: The computer vision, as well as the experience, is fully on the frontend. It is quick, confidential and it does not need any backend.
